# Lattice Research Skill

Lattice Research Skill is a portable Agent Skills package for AI research agents such as Cursor, Claude, VS Code/GitHub Copilot, and other tools that support `SKILL.md`-based skills. It is designed for full-text literature work rather than abstract-only screening.

The core pain point is that a paper's abstract and conclusion often do not expose the concrete numerical values, experimental procedures, boundary conditions, figures, tables, or supplementary details needed for serious research-gap analysis. Lattice connects the research workflow to Zotero and local PDF evidence so users can reason from full text, not from summaries.

## Core Idea

Lattice helps organize scientific literature into structured evidence trees:

- `data tree`: numerical values, parameters, variables, observed objects, outcomes, and evidence levels.
- `experiment tree`: material preparation, test conditions, protocols, controlled variables, missing variables, and reproducibility blockers.
- `method tree`: measurement methods, modeling assumptions, finite-element parameters, calibration choices, visibility limits, and validation status.

These structures make the research-assistance chain explicit:

```text
Zotero + PDFs + supplements + an Agent Skills-compatible AI agent
  -> data / experiment / method extraction
  -> comparability and evidence-level audit
  -> candidate Research Gap
  -> Anti-Gap verification
  -> narrowed, evidence-bound research opportunity
```

## Skills Included

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lattice-research-skill` | Router for the Lattice workflow. |
| `lattice-find-papers` | Searches literature, screens candidates, imports selected DOI records into Zotero, checks full-text availability, and prepares `request_PDF/doi_list.md`. |
| `lattice-gaps` | Reads `request_PDF`, Zotero PDFs/indexed full text, and Find Papers manifests; builds evidence trees; finds data/method/experiment gaps; supports verify-only Anti-Gap checks. |
| `lattice-wording` | Wording review skill. This is still accumulating rules and examples. |
| `lattice-honesty` | Evidence-bound honesty and overclaim audit. This and related skills are still being optimized. |

## Anti-Gap Status

`Lattice Anti-Gap` is intentionally not included as a separate active skill in this release.

Anti-Gap is now embedded inside `lattice-gaps`. Users can skip the gap-discovery stage and directly run reverse verification:

```text
Use lattice-gaps verify-only mode to check whether this proposed gap is real.
```

This avoids maintaining two separate gap-verification paths.

## Zotero-Based Workflow

Lattice assumes a Zotero-centered workflow:

1. `lattice-find-papers` retrieves and screens papers.
2. Screened DOI records are imported or matched in Zotero when possible.
3. Zotero PDF / indexed full-text status is recorded in `zotero_import_manifest.csv`.
4. Missing PDFs or supplements are written to `request_PDF/doi_list.md`.
5. `lattice-gaps` consumes the resulting PDFs, Zotero records, and manifests.

Important evidence rule:

> DOI metadata, abstracts, and web snippets can locate papers or refute broad claims, but they are not full-text evidence for numerical values or experimental procedures.

## Zotero Setup Guide

Detailed Zotero configuration instructions are maintained separately here:

[Zotero Configuration for Lattice](docs/zotero-configuration.md)

The main page intentionally keeps only this entry point so the setup guide can be updated independently.

## Installation

Clone this repository and copy the skills into the skill directory used by your AI agent:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stephendahe/lattice-research-skill.git
cd lattice-research-skill
```

Common install targets:

```bash
# Cursor global skills
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills
cp -R skills/lattice-* ~/.cursor/skills/

# Claude global skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R skills/lattice-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

For project-local installs, copy the same `skills/lattice-*` folders into the project skill directory supported by your agent.

If your agent does not support automatic skill discovery, use [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) as the repository-level entry point.

See the full multi-agent installation guide:

[Agent Installation Guide](docs/agent-installation.md)

## Requirements

- An AI agent with Agent Skills / `SKILL.md` support, or an agent that can read this repository as project instructions.
- Zotero Desktop for the Zotero-backed workflow.
- A working Zotero local API / connector setup if you want DOI import, Zotero search, attachment lookup, or indexed full-text reading.
- Local PDFs or user-supplied full texts for strong data/method/experiment conclusions.

## Current Development Status

- `Lattice Wording`: continuously accumulating wording rules.
- `Lattice Honesty`: actively being optimized for evidence-bound scientific writing.
- `Lattice Gaps`: active core module for data, experiment, method, parameter-drift, and Anti-Gap workflows.
- `Lattice Anti-Gap`: deprecated as an independent skill; use `Lattice Gaps` verify-only mode.

## Evidence Boundaries

Lattice does not bypass paywalls and does not claim to read inaccessible PDFs. When full text, figures, tables, or supplementary materials are missing, the correct output is a request or evidence blocker, not a fake conclusion.

No copyrighted PDFs are included in this repository.
